# spring-mvc

Problem: I tried this very simple code on spring MVC but the code is not working and it gives the error --
          HTTP Status 500 – Internal Server Error
          Type: Exception Report
          Message: Error instantiating servlet class [org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet]
          Description: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
        
Description about the application: After running the application on http://localhost:8080/MVCproject it will ask for 2 numbers as input and after we click on submit,
                            it should print the containt of "Display.jsp" file i.e. "i m here", but instead of that it gives HTTP Status 500 – Internal Server Error.
